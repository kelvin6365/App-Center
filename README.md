## _Manage Your Apps with Ease_

App Center is a SaaS platform that makes it easy for teams to build,
distribute, and manage their apps in one place.

## Introduction

As a developer, I built this platform because managing the entire app lifecycle was always a headache.
There were too many disjointed tools and too much complexity.

I designed App Center to simplify the process by bringing everything together in a unified dashboard. Now teams can:

- Quickly build and configure iOS, Android, web, and desktop apps
- Easily manage releases across multiple environments
- Distribute apps to public and private markets
- Get powerful analytics around adoption, usage, demographics etc.
- Integrate with existing tools like Jira and Slack
- With App Center, developers can focus on creating great apps rather than wrestling with complexity. And it's easy for anyone to start managing their apps smarter.

## Features

- App Creation - Easily build and configure new apps
- Version Control - Manage releases and track build history
- App Distribution - Distribute to app stores and internal testers
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Analytics - Get insights into adoption, engagement and performance
